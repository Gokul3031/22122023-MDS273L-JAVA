lab Question:

Write a Java Program that will collect an employee's basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'.
It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). 
If the employee is from the southern part of India, with the help of a switch statement, 
it should display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>", along with the basic details.
Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple);
if so, print a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".


lab Description:

* This Java code is a program that takes input from the user about an employee's details, including the employee's name, age, gender, state, and company. The input is taken through a Scanner object and stored in variables such as "name", "age", "gender", "state", and "company".

* The program then prints out the employee's details in a readable format and checks if the employee is from one of the southern states of India (Andhra, Karnataka, Kerala, or Tamil Nadu). If the employee is from one of these states, the program outputs which city in the state would be the preferred work location for the employee.

* The program also checks if the employee is working in one of several top multinational companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, or Apple). If the employee is working in one of these companies, the program outputs a message indicating this.
