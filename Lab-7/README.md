Lab-7 Question:

Create a new folder in git named 'Lab 7' for the following question and solve the following: create a flowchart and document the results, constraints, etc., in the README.md file for the lab.

Given the famous iris dataset, find the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.

Once the overall summary statistics have been calculated, identify the summary statistics for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].

Present your results in the appropriate format and write the results in a file.

lab-7 description:

Problem Description
In this lab, we will use the famous iris dataset to calculate the 5-point summary [Mean, Median, Mode, Min, Max] for the attributes: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm. We will also calculate the 5-point summary for each Species of iris flower [Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica].

Dataset
The iris dataset is a multivariate dataset that contains measurements for the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three different species of iris flowers. The dataset has a total of 150 observations, with 50 observations for each species.

Results
5-point summary for all attributes:

SepalLengthCm: Mean = 5.84, Median = 5.80, Mode = Not available, Min = 4.30, Max = 7.90
SepalWidthCm: Mean = 3.05, Median = 3.00, Mode = 3.00, Min = 2.00, Max = 4.40
PetalLengthCm: Mean = 3.76, Median = 4.35, Mode = Not available, Min = 1.00, Max = 6.90
PetalWidthCm: Mean = 1.20, Median = 1.30, Mode = 0.20, Min = 0.10, Max = 2.50
5-point summary for each Species of iris flower:

Iris-setosa:
SepalLengthCm: Mean = 5.01, Median = 5.00, Mode = Not available, Min = 4.30, Max = 5.80
SepalWidthCm: Mean = 3.42, Median = 3.40, Mode = 3.40, Min = 2.30, Max = 4.40
PetalLengthCm: Mean = 1.46, Median = 1.50, Mode = 1.50
